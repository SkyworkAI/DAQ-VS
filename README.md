## TODO
- Release the code and pre-trained weights.

## Features
- We propose Dynamic Anchor Queries and Emergence and Disappearance Simulation to significantly enhance the ability to handle the emergence and disappearance of objects.
- The Dynamic Anchor Queries and Emergence and Disappearance Simulation proposed by us can be easily integrated into existing query-based video segmentation methods.
- By integrating with DVIS, we constructed DVIS-DAQ and achieved SOTA performance on YTVIS 19/21/22 and VIPSeg, with performance reaching as high as **57.1 AP** on OVIS.

## Demos
We provide visualization results for multiple challenging cases on the [project page](https://zhang-tao-whu.github.io/projects/DVIS_DAQ/).
